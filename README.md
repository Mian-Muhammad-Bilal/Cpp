# My C++ Journey

Welcome to my C++ journey repository! This space documents my progression in learning C++ programming, serving as a timeline of my projects and growth. C++ was my first programming language, and this repository reflects the journey of my skills from a novice to a more proficient developer.

## Topics Covered
Throughout my journey, I've learned fundamental concepts and advanced topics, including:
- Programming Fundamentals
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Data Structures and Algorithms

### Programming Fundamentals:
- This repository on Programming Fundamentals (PF) covers basic topics in C++, including practice exercises, operations, arrays, loops, functions, exams, and a notable projectâ€”the Car Parking Management system. It delves into the foundational aspects of C++ from the first semester, offering a robust base for continued exploration and learning.

### Object-Oriented Programming
- This repository comprehensively covers Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) topics, including classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction, constructors, destructors, and operator overloading. It encompasses a variety of hands-on exercises, assignments, and practical applications to reinforce and apply these OOP principles.

### Data Structures and Algorithms
- This repository includes Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) topics, featuring arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, sorting algorithms like merge and insertion, searching techniques, the Tower of Hanoi, and more. It incorporates a diverse range of content, including assignments, lab tasks, practice exercises, and exam quizzes. Dive into this repository to explore and deepen your understanding of fundamental DSA concepts through hands-on exercises and practical applications.

## Projects
Explore the various projects that mark different milestones in my journey. Each project is a testament to the knowledge gained and challenges overcome.

- [Car Parking System](https://github.com/Mian-Muhammad-Bilal/Car-Parking-System):
The Car Parking System, is a C++ project focused on Programming Fundamentals. Tailored for effective parking management, the program ensures secure access through the specified username and password. It adeptly handles the arrivals and departures of various vehicle types, including Bikes, Cars, Buses, Rishkaws, and Bicycles. Notable features include transaction recording for each vehicle type, automatic fee calculation, and user-friendly options for editing or deleting parking records. With a straightforward menu, this C++ project provides a foundational understanding of programming fundamentals while addressing practical parking management needs.

- [Hostel Managment System](link-to-project2):
The Hostel Management System is a C++ object-oriented programming (OOP) project. It employs classes to organize and manage hostel accommodations across three floors. The system tracks room occupancy and offers functionalities like booking for one, two, or three persons, as well as canceling reservations and updating information. The implementation follows an object-oriented approach in C++.

## Institute
